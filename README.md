## Slide 1 - Introduction
#### Group name: Eureka
#### Project name: Metro Bike Sharing
#### Group member:  
* Yiran Li - liyiran@usc.edu
* Xiner Ning - xinernin@usc.edu
* Yueqin Yang - yueqinya@usc.edu

## Slide 2 - Why we chose this project and Why is our project interesting?
- Hobby 
- Reduce traffic jam
- Eco-friendly, reduce air pollution
- New market
- Close to our daily life
- New area  no research before
- Enough data and authentic

## Slide 3 -  Who is the audience for our project?
- L.A. residents
- Visitors
- Bike renting company
- Professor / graders

## Slide 4 - Why is our visualization important?
- Reveal patterns and trends
- Reveal features in data not otherwise apparent
- Inform and engage more diverse audiences

## Slide 5 - How is our visualization useful?
- Carefully selected features
- No fake data / preprocessed data
- Use most suitable charts to display different features

## Slide 6 - What are you telling with your visualization? What is the story?
We do have a very long story to tell but some of them are **current** only in concept. The following list is something most realistic.
_The list will be changed along with progress_
- **Bicycle usage** based on _Line Chart_
- **Station distribution** based on _Dot Map_
- **Bike availability** based on _Proportional Symbol Map_ 
etc...

## Slide 7- How do you plan to use interactive visuals?
- [Google map javascript api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) 
- [Mouse Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) 
- Different **filters** for letting user choose a portion of data without losing generality

## Slide 8- What are your design considerations?
We have many different dimensions for design considerations which focus on different aspects, e.g. _technique_, _feature engineering_, _team building_, _collaboration_ etc.
I, hereby, will focus on technique part. 

In the website, we apply [Model-View-Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter) architecture. _HTML_ and _CSS_ will take care of **View** while _Javascript_ is for **Model** and **View**.

Equipped with the knowledge from the lecture, we use **Visualization wheel** for letting out interface elegant and different **design pattern**, e.g. _factory pattern_, _singleton pattern_ to increase _aggregation_ and decrease _coupling_. 
## Slide 9- What are the components that make your visualization cool?
We, the People, is our core competence which will make our project looks elegant and robust (Forgive me, I do not like the word "cool" because it is so abstract). We have one artist, one senior team leader and an energetic freshman.
- Excellent aesthetics
- Expertise on the data
- Passion from our team-members
 
## Slide 10- How does your visualization compare to what others have done?
Our project is **NOT** groundless. We stand on the shoulders of giants. After doing search some research, we find that our project is very unique. We list the current research for [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy)
- [ofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofo_(company)) / [mobike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobike) - no satisfiable visualizations
- Car-sharing e.g. [Car-to-go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car2go) real time info / chromatic data analysis
- [Metro bike](https://bikeshare.metro.net) existing visualization only has few dimensions / multi-charts analysis, diverse audiences
 
## Slide 11 - What are the technologies you plan to use?
- Bootstrap
- D3.js
- Google Maps API
- Angular
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Font Awesome
- Underscore.js
- Backbone.js

## Slide 12 - How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?
Developing based on **Agile Model**
1. Design
    - Brainstorm on whiteboard
    - Inkscape digitalize
    - Excel prototype
2. Build
    - Visual Studio Code - IDE
    - JavaScript - programming language
    - CSS - styling
    - GitHub - version control
3. Evaluate 
    - Unit test for JavaScript
    - Multi-browser testing
    - A/B test
## Slide 13 - What are your deliverables?
- Webpage
- Video
- Paper
- Presentation
- Publish on web server

## Slide 14 - How do you work together?
- Meeting - brainstorm
- GitHub - distributed development
- WeChat - asynchronous/long-distance communication

## Slide 15 - What is your timeline?
