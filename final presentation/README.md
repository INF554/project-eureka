## Slide 2 - What our visualization is about?
- To show does the metro bike station set properly? 
- Does it need more stations in some regions?

## Slide 3 -  who is it addressed to?
- Bike rental company
- Professor, TA

## Slide 4 - Why it is interesting, original, useful?
- New market
- Close to our daily life
- New area no research before
- Enough data and authentic

## Slide 5 - Work distribution
- Yiran: framework and maps
- Xiner: navigation and charts
- Yueqin: data and charts

## Slide 6 - Explain that data and topic as needed to understand the project
- we use a d3 map to show the combination of bike stations, public transportations, to show whether we need add stations in some new regions
- we use the bar charts to show the usage for existing stations, to show whether we need add more docks for those existing stations

## Slide 7 - Researchs
- Metro bike website
- vue
- bootstrop
- professor examples

## Slide 8 - What others have done in the same topic, other topics that are relevant?
- Our project is NOT groundless. We stand on the shoulders of giants. After doing search some research, we find that our project is very unique. We list the current research for sharing economy
- ofo / mobike - no satisfiable visualizations
- Car-sharing e.g. Car-to-go real time info / chromatic data analysis
- Metro bike existing visualization only has few dimensions / multi-charts

## Slide 9- What are the components that make your visualization cool?
We, the People, is our core competence which will make our project looks elegant and robust (Forgive me, I do not like the word "cool" because it is so abstract). We have one artist, one senior team leader and an energetic freshman.
- Excellent aesthetics
- Expertise on the data
- Passion from our team-members
 
## Slide 10- How does your visualization compare to what others have done?
Our project is **NOT** groundless. We stand on the shoulders of giants. After doing search some research, we find that our project is very unique. We list the current research for [sharing economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing_economy)
- [ofo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofo_(company)) / [mobike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobike) - no satisfiable visualizations
- Car-sharing e.g. [Car-to-go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car2go) real time info / chromatic data analysis
- [Metro bike](https://bikeshare.metro.net) existing visualization only has few dimensions / multi-charts analysis, diverse audiences
 
## Slide 11 - What are the technologies you plan to use?
- Bootstrap
- D3.js
- Google Maps API
- Angular
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Font Awesome
- Underscore.js
- Backbone.js
